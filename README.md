## screenhook
originally made to make up for features BTT lacks like:
- running applescript when monitor is attached/detached
- running applescript when you click on a corner
- running applescript for any click (without modifiers keys held) 

["steviaOS"](https://github.com/steventheworker/applescripts) features:
- firefox cmd+shift+T to reopen tabs AND windows
- make sure afterBTTLaunched.applescript ran, launch DockAltTab after
- "Spotlight Search.app" will only work with screenhook

planned features:
- awareness of spaces
- applescript definitions - to share space awareness
- change middle mouse button behavior
